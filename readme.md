# Reactive RESTful API — Spring WebFlux

> **Archived project** — built a few years ago as a learning exercise and left untouched since.
> It was **not** migrated to Spring Boot 3 or 4. Instead, the codebase was refreshed just enough
> to compile and run on its original **Spring Boot 2.4.4 / Java 17** baseline
> (compatibility fixes: [pom.xml overhaul](https://github.com/mrzodeczko-dev/Archived-Reactive-RESTful-API-with-Spring-Webflux/commit/0bac2c97082c9db635f06e1275dacf682869012a)).
>
> ⚠️ **Migration note:** The Spring ecosystem changed significantly between Spring Boot 2.x and
> Spring Boot 3.x / 4.x. A real migration would require:
> - Full `javax.*` → `jakarta.*` package rename (breaking change in every file)
> - Spring Security 6 rewrite — `WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter` removed, replaced with `SecurityFilterChain` beans
> - Mongock API changes (4.x → 5.x driver model)
> - Spring Data MongoDB reactive API updates
> - Minimum Java version bumped to 17 (Boot 3) / 21 (Boot 4)
>
> The project is kept as-is for reference and portfolio purposes.

A reactive REST API built with **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** on top of Spring WebFlux and Netty. The full I/O pipeline is non-blocking: WebFlux router + reactive MongoDB driver + replica set transactions — no blocking thread is ever held during a request.

---

## Prerequisites

- **Docker** and **Docker Compose** (Docker Swarm mode enabled for swarm deployment)
- **Java 17** + **Maven 3.8+** (for local build)

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Build the application (skip tests for speed)
mvn clean package -DskipTests

# 2. Start all containers (app + MongoDB replica set)
docker-compose up -d --build
```

Swagger UI available at: [http://localhost:8080/docs](http://localhost:8080/docs)

## Architecture

The entire application is containerised. The layered Docker image build uses `maven-dependency-plugin` to split the fat JAR into **dependencies** and **classes** — dependencies are cached between builds, only changed classes are re-copied:

```
┌──────────────────────────────┐
│  CLASSES  (changes each build)│
├──────────────────────────────┤
│  DEPENDENCIES  (cached)      │
├──────────────────────────────┤
│  JRE (eclipse-temurin:17)    │
└──────────────────────────────┘
```

Two Docker Compose files are provided:

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `docker-compose.yml` | Local development — builds image from source |
| `docker-swarm.yml` | Production — deploys a stack to Docker Swarm |

---

## MongoDB Replica Set

The app uses **MongoDB distributed transactions**, which require a replica set. Three nodes are configured:

- **1 Primary** — receives all write operations
- **2 Secondaries** — replicate the primary's oplog asynchronously

Read preference is set to `primaryPreferred` to maximise consistency while allowing reads from secondaries if the primary is unavailable.

![MongoDB replica set](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/images/replica-set-primary-with-two-secondaries.bakedsvg.svg)

All replica nodes are containerised with persistent volumes:

## Docker Commands

### Docker Compose (development)

```bash
# Start all containers in the background
docker-compose up -d --build

# Follow logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Stop and remove containers, networks, volumes
docker-compose down
```

### Docker Swarm (production)

```bash
# Deploy stack
docker stack deploy -c docker-swarm.yml <appName>

# List stack tasks
docker stack ps <appName>

# Remove stack
docker stack rm <appName>
```

## Why Reactive?

According to [Spring MVC vs WebFlux performance benchmarks](https://filia-aleks.medium.com/microservice-performance-battle-spring-mvc-vs-webflux-80d39fd81bf0):

> Spring WebFlux with WebClient wins in all cases. The most significant difference (4× faster than blocking Servlet) appears when the underlying service is slow (500 ms). It is 15–20% faster than a non-blocking Servlet with `CompletableFuture`, and uses far fewer threads (20 vs 220).

### When to use reactive

- ✅ High-concurrency, I/O-bound workloads
- ✅ All dependencies have async/reactive drivers (MongoDB reactive, WebClient, etc.)
- ❌ Avoid where blocking calls are unavoidable without custom thread-pool wrappers
- ❌ Avoid when transactional complexity (multi-document updates) outweighs the concurrency benefit
